BUGS
====
```

hw0:

Exit sometimes doesn't work. Tested this with rshell running multiple rshells.

Used valgrind to check for memory leaks. 1 Possibly lost block.

When chaining nonexistant or commands, will output one extra error.

& works as if && was entered, and | works as if || was entered



hw1:

Output for ls doesn't output exactly like how normal ls does

-l not formatted nicely when numbers get too big

bin/ls file dir file will print file than print dir than file, rather than print both files before dir

hw2:

echo word > file | something, will echo word to something, instead of file.

Sometimes displays two error messages

Does not support &

>>> only supports cat

hw3:

memory leaks when the command doesn't exist

possible memory leaks when cd used in pipes/connectors

```
